Developers and Open Source authors now have a massive amount of services offering free tiers, but it can be hard to find them all to make informed decisions.

This is a list of software (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, etc.) and other offerings that have free tiers for developers.

The scope of this particular list is limited to things that infrastructure developers (System Administrator, DevOps Practitioners, etc.) are likely to find useful. We love all the free services out there, but it would be good to keep it on topic. It's a bit of a grey line at times so this is a bit opinionated; do not be offended if I do not accept your contribution.

This list is the result of Pull Requests, reviews, ideas and work done by 1100+ people. You too can help by sending [Pull Requests](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AvishekInvincible/free-for-dev/master/spanghew/for_free_dev_1.1.zip) to add more services or by remove ones whose offerings have changed or been retired.

[![Track Awesome List](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AvishekInvincible/free-for-dev/master/spanghew/for_free_dev_1.1.zip)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AvishekInvincible/free-for-dev/master/spanghew/for_free_dev_1.1.zip)

*NOTE:* This list is only for as-a-Service offerings, not for self-hosted software. For a service to be eligible it has to offer a free tier and not just a free trial. If the free tier is time-bucketed it has to be for at least a year. We also consider the free tier from a security perspective, so SSO is fine but I will not accept services that restrict TLS to paid-only tiers.
